# Jenkins CI/CD (Declarative Pipeline) with GitHub Integration (Deploying Django Notes Application)

This documentation outlines the process of setting up a **CI/CD pipeline** using **Jenkins**, **GitHub**, and **Docker** for deploying a **Django Notes Application**. This integration allows for seamless deployments whenever changes are made in the GitHub repository. The guide includes detailed steps and descriptions to ensure that no important information is left out.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, we will:

1. **Create an EC2 instance** on AWS to host Jenkins and Docker.
2. **Set up Jenkins** to automate the CI/CD process.
3. **Use Docker** to containerize the Django application.
4. **Integrate GitHub** for automatic deployments upon code changes.

---

## Steps to Implement the Project

### 1. Create an AWS EC2 Instance

To host the Jenkins server, we first need to create an EC2 instance on AWS.

1. **Login to AWS**:
   - Navigate to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:
   - Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** and click on **Launch Instance**.
   - Select the **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** AMI from the list of available Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
   - Choose the **t2.micro** instance type, which is eligible for the free tier.
   - Click **Next: Configure Instance Details** and proceed through the default settings.
   - In the **Configure Security Group** section, create a new security group allowing **SSH (port 22)** for connecting to the instance and **HTTP (port 80)** for web traffic.

3. **Connect to EC2 Instance**:
   - After launching the instance, you can connect to it using SSH. Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `<your-key>.pem` with your key file and `<your-ec2-public-ip>` with your instance's public IP address:
   
   ```bash
   ssh -i <your-key>.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
   ```

---

### 2. Update the EC2 Instance

Before installing any packages, ensure that your instance is up-to-date. This practice helps prevent issues related to outdated packages.

1. **Run the following command**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
   This command updates the package lists for upgrades and new package installations.

---

### 3. Install Java

Since Jenkins is built using Java, you need to install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to ensure Jenkins runs correctly.

1. **Install OpenJDK 17**:
   - Run the following command to install the latest version of OpenJDK:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
   ```

2. **Verify Java Installation**:
   - Check whether Java is installed by running:
   
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

---

### 4. Install Jenkins

Now that Java is installed, you can proceed to install Jenkins, which will be used to create the CI/CD pipeline.

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to install required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
   ```

2. **Add Jenkins Key**:
   - Execute the following command to add the Jenkins key:
   
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
   ```

3. **Add Jenkins Repository**:
   - Add the Jenkins repository to your system:
   
   ```bash
   echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
   ```

4. **Update Package Index**:
   - Run the following command to update the package index:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

5. **Install Jenkins**:
   - Execute the following command to install Jenkins:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install jenkins
   ```

6. **Enable Jenkins**:
   - Enable Jenkins to start at boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable jenkins
   ```

7. **Start Jenkins**:
   - Start the Jenkins service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

8. **Check Jenkins Status**:
   - Verify that Jenkins is running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status jenkins
   ```

9. **Access Jenkins**:
   - Jenkins runs on port 8080. To access Jenkins, go to your EC2 instance's public IP address with port 8080 in your web browser:

   ```
   http://<instance_public_ip>:8080
   ```

10. **Configure Security Group**:
    - In the AWS EC2 dashboard, go to the **Security Group** of your instance, edit the inbound rules, and add a rule for **port 8080**.
